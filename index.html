          <p>Ghihi, I'm posting as Ninja now, but don't worry, it's still just little old me ;) </p>
          <p>These challenges are so simple, but I know that in a few clicks they will get harder so I'm paying attention to what I do. <br>
          I struggled a bit with the github posting of pages but that was because the 404 of when it was still private was still cached. <br>
          Silly me!</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>So a few weeks ago, I started exploring some web development with <a href="https://getmimo.com">M1m0</a>. <br>
            Now, as some of you might know, I have been dabbling with development years ago, as I started my bachelor of IT in 2009.</p>
          <p>It didn't work out at that time, ans as I'm starting again this fall, I want to be ahead of the game and start with some easy coding now.  </p>
